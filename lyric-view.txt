[Verse 1]


I remember when

I remember, I remember when I lost my mind

There was something so pleasant about that place

Even your emotions had an echo

In so much space


And when you're out there

Without care

Yeah, I was out of touch


But it wasn't because I didn't know enough

I just knew too much



[Chorus]


Does that make me crazy?

Does that make me crazy?

Does that make me crazy?

Probably



[Verse 2]


And I hope that you are having the time of your life

But think twice

That's my only advice


Come on now, who do you

Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?


Ha ha ha, bless your soul


You really think you're in control?



[Chorus]


Well, I think you're crazy

I think you're crazy

I think you're crazy

Just like me



[Verse 3]


My heroes had the heart

To lose the life I'd want to live

And all I remember is thinking I want to be like them


Ever since I was little

Ever since I was little, it looked like fun

And it's no coincidence I've come

And I can die when I'm done



[Chorus]


But maybe I'm crazy

Maybe you're crazy

Maybe we're crazy

Probably
